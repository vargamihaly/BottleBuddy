        questions: {
          payment: {
            question: "When do I get paid for my bottles?",
            answer: "You get paid immediately during the pickup! The volunteer pays you your agreed share upfront (for example, 25 HUF per bottle if you agreed on a 50/50 split). There's no need to meet again after the exchange."
          },
          split: {
            question: "How does the payment split work?",
            answer: "You decide the split when creating your listing (e.g., 50/50, 60/40, etc.). The volunteer pays you your portion upfront during pickup, then they return the bottles to get the full 50 HUF refund and keep their share. For example: if you have 100 bottles and agree on 50/50, the volunteer pays you 2,500 HUF during pickup, then gets 5,000 HUF from the store."
          },
          risk: {
            question: "What if the volunteer doesn't return the bottles?",
            answer: "You've already received your payment upfront, so there's no risk to you! The volunteer is motivated to return the bottles because that's how they earn their portion of the refund. Our rating system helps build trust in the community."
          },
          meetings: {
            question: "Do I need to meet the volunteer twice?",
            answer: "No! You only meet once during pickup when you hand over the bottles and receive your payment. The volunteer handles returning the bottles on their own and keeps their share. It's one meeting, one payment, done."
          },
          agreement: {
            question: "How do we agree on the split?",
            answer: "When creating your listing, you set your preferred split (e.g., \"I want 25 HUF per bottle\"). Volunteers see this and can send a pickup request if they agree. You can also discuss and negotiate via the in-app messaging before accepting a request."
          },
          safety: {
            question: "Is it safe to invite someone to my home?",
            answer: "Your safety is important! You can choose to meet at a public location instead of your home. Our platform includes user ratings and reviews so you can see other people's experiences. You can also chat with volunteers first to get comfortable before accepting a pickup request."
          },
          create: {
            question: "How do I create a bottle listing?",
            answer: "After signing in, click the \"List Your Bottles\" button on the home page or in the header. Enter how many bottles you have, your location, and your preferred split percentage. You can also add photos and additional details to help volunteers."
          },
          cancel: {
            question: "Can I cancel a pickup request?",
            answer: "Yes! Both the listing owner and the volunteer can cancel a pickup request before it's completed. If you're the owner, you can reject requests. If you're the volunteer, you can cancel your request. Just remember to communicate via the chat if there's a change of plans."
          },
          rating: {
            question: "How does the rating system work?",
            answer: "After completing a pickup, both parties can rate each other on a scale of 1-5 stars and leave a comment. Ratings help build trust in the community and let users see who is reliable. Your average rating is displayed on your profile."
          },
          bottles: {
            question: "What types of bottles can I list?",
            answer: "Any returnable plastic bottles that are accepted at Hungarian stores for the 50 HUF deposit refund. This includes most beverage bottles (water, soda, juice, etc.). Make sure bottles are empty and reasonably clean before pickup."

            question: "Hogyan működik a fizetés megosztása?",
            answer: "Te döntöd el az osztást a hirdetés létrehozásakor (pl. 50/50, 60/40 stb.). Az önkéntes az átvételkor kifizeti neked a részedet, majd visszaviszi a palackokat, hogy megkapja a teljes 50 Ft-os visszatérítést és megtartsa a részét. Például: ha 100 palackod van és 50/50-ben állapodtok meg, az önkéntes az átvételkor fizet neked 2500 Ft-ot, majd 5000 Ft-ot kap a boltból."

            question: "Mi van, ha az önkéntes nem viszi vissza a palackokat?",
            answer: "A kifizetésedet már előre megkaptad, így nincs kockázat számodra! Az önkéntes motivált a palackok visszavitelére, mert így keresi meg a részét a visszatérítésből. Az értékelési rendszerünk segít a bizalom építésében a közösségen belül."

            answer: "Nem! Csak egyszer találkoztok az átvételkor, amikor átadod a palackokat és megkapod a kifizetésedet. Az önkéntes egyedül intézi a visszaváltást és megtartja a részét. Egy találkozó, egy fizetés, kész."

          agreement: {
            question: "Hogyan állapodunk meg az osztásról?",
            answer: "A hirdetés létrehozásakor beállítod a preferált osztásodat (pl. \"25 Ft/palackot szeretnék\"). Az önkéntesek látják ezt, és átvételi kérelmet küldhetnek, ha egyetértenek. Az alkalmazáson belüli üzenetküldéssel is megbeszélhetitek és tárgyalhattok a kérelem elfogadása előtt."

Platformunk felhasználói értékeléseket és véleményeket tartalmaz, így láthatod mások tapasztalatait.

Az értékelések segítenek a bizalom építésében a közösségen belül, és lehetővé teszik a felhasználók számára, hogy lássák, ki megbízható. Az átlagos értékelésed megjelenik a profilodban."
